His solid ball-handling skills (4.1 assists per game) and ability to create opportunities can complement Derrick Rose's driving ability, while his physical presence (240 lbs) adds much-needed strength to the lineup. Although his outside shooting is streaky, his overall skill set aligns well with the Bulls' need for a dynamic scorer and playmaker on the wing. <|endoftext|>"}

{"text": "Team: Portland Trail Blazers\nPosition of Pick: PG\nContext: The Blazers don’t have a lot of needs, as they have a deep, young team that is solid all around.

They have a few shooting guards and Dirk Nowitzki and Josh Howard occupy the forward spots, so there aren’t any desperate needs there.

{"text": "Team: Boston Celtics\nPosition of Pick: PG\nContext: Rajon Rondo is a quality point guard, but the Celtics don’t have any real point guards to back him up.
