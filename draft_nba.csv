That flexibility became immediately evident with the trade they made to move up from the No. 17 spot to No. 10, taking on salary commitment in the form of Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe and landing a 2022 first-round pick by way of the Lakers. The Grizzlies front office has been reshaped from being the butt of many jokes around the NBA to a force to be reckoned with in the past few years, and they will likely continue to make savvy moves around the edges to build around Morant and make even more progress in the win column.\n\nZiaire Williams started the season projected as a top-5 pick but saw his stock drop after a disappointing, disjointed campaign at Stanford.
