Position of Pick: SF
Context: If the Hornets stay put at No. 6, they should be looking at wings who can defend and take over playmaking duties if LaMelo Ball suffers further ankle injuries. Charlotte finished 29th in team defense last season and could use a point-of-attack defender in the backcourt like UConn’s Stephon Castle.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Tidjane Salaün (SF)
Why: Charlotte surprised many by taking 18-year-old Salaün for his rare combination of size, shooting potential, and defensive intensity. The pick complements the Hornets’ core of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller, projecting Salaün as a long-term power forward. He may be a season or two away from making high-level contributions. <|endoftext|>"
Portland Trail Blazers,2024,"Team: Portland Trail Blazers
Position of Pick: C
Context: Portland, with four picks, must fill its wing rotation around Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe — targeting floor-spacing wings like Matas Buzelis or Dalton Knecht.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Donovan Clingan (C)
Why: Portland landed Clingan at No. 7 after he unexpectedly fell out of lottery range, securing the draft’s premier rim-protector. The Blazers will integrate his shot-blocking behind their young perimeter talent and reshape the frontcourt around him. Clingan’s defensive impact could catalyze subsequent roster moves. <|endoftext|>"
Minnesota Timberwolves,2024,"Team: Minnesota Timberwolves
Position of Pick: PG/SG
Context: Mike Conley Jr. turns 37 this fall, and with other veterans expiring, Minnesota needs playmaking depth — targeting a backup point guard who can learn and eventually take over.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Rob Dillingham (PG/SG)
Why: Minnesota traded significant future capital to vault into No. 8 and pair Dillingham with Anthony Edwards long term. They targeted his dynamic scoring and playmaking to refresh the backcourt as Mike Conley ages out. Dillingham’s shot-making and creativity offer upside despite his size limitations. <|endoftext|>"
Memphis Grizzlies,2024,"Team: Memphis Grizzlies
Position of Pick: C
Context: Memphis should be extremely interested in trading up for Donovan Clingan, a potential franchise center to pair with Jaren Jackson Jr., or grab a power forward with size and mobility.

Available Players:

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Zach Edey (C)
Why: Memphis stood pat at No. 9 to select Edey, a bruising center prototype to partner with Jaren Jackson Jr. His throwback physicality and mismatch scoring made him the best remaining big on the board. Edey fills the Grizzlies’ need for a traditional rim-running center in their frontcourt rebuild. <|endoftext|>"
Utah Jazz,2024,"Team: Utah Jazz
Position of Pick: SG/SF
Context: After posting the worst defensive rating in NBA history, Utah needs defensive help in the backcourt — two-way wings like Ron Holland or Devin Carter can address this need.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Cody Williams (SG/SF)
Why: Utah swung on Williams’ upside as a long, versatile defender with playmaking potential despite his inconsistent freshman season. The Jazz signaled a youth movement by favoring his developmental trajectory over an older veteran like Knecht. Williams represents a higher-ceiling bet in a gradual rebuild. <|endoftext|>"
Chicago Bulls,2024,"Team: Chicago Bulls
Position of Pick: SF/PF
Context: With Coby White and Nikola Vučević locked in at point guard and center, Chicago should target a forward in case DeMar DeRozan departs. The Bulls also need shooting after ranking 27th in made threes per game; Colorado’s Cody Williams would be an ideal fit.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Matas Buzelis (SF/PF)
Why: Chicago gambled on Buzelis falling into their laps at No. 11, adding local talent with positional size and athletic upside. Artūras Karnišovas and the Bulls front office know him well and believe his growth as a shooter and shot-creator can flourish alongside their young core. Buzelis provides value well below earlier projections. <|endoftext|>"
Oklahoma City Thunder,2024,"Team: Oklahoma City Thunder
Position of Pick: PG
Context: OKC could reunite Cody Williams with brother Jalen, adding a versatile forward. If he’s gone, they should address size/rebounding with a prospect like Zach Edey or Kel’el Ware.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Nikola Topić (PG)
Why: Oklahoma City traded Giddey’s replacement and drafted Topić at No. 12 despite ACL concerns, valuing his elite pick-and-roll creation. The Thunder’s patient developmental environment suits his recovery timeline and long-term ceiling. Topić adds another intriguing skill-position prospect to OKC’s deep talent pool. <|endoftext|>"
Sacramento Kings,2024,"Team: Sacramento Kings

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Devin Carter (SG)
Why: Sacramento pounced on Carter at No. 13 after he slipped past Chicago, securing a proven two-way guard for their playoff window. His defensive tenacity and rebounding blend with timely scoring fit perfectly alongside Fox and Monk. Carter’s veteran poise and toughness fill an immediate role off the bench. <|endoftext|>"
Washington Wizards,2024,"Team: Washington Wizards
Position of Pick: SG
Context: The Wizards’ primary needs are at point guard and center, but more than anything, they crave a star — casting a wide net for whoever projects to be one, from Alex Sarr to Zaccharie Risacher.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Bub Carrington (SG)
Why: Washington used the No. 14 pick to add Baltimore native Carrington as a developmental point guard near home. He joins an overhaul of the Wizards’ backcourt alongside Alex Sarr and Bilal Coulibaly under a youth-first approach. Carrington’s size and mid-range game project well in their vision. <|endoftext|>"
Miami Heat,2024,"Team: Miami Heat
Position of Pick: C
Context: After drafting Jaime Jaquez Jr., Miami should again target a ready-to-play forward who can contribute immediately, such as Tristan da Silva or Devin Carter, to keep their Finals window open.

Available Players:

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Kel'el Ware (C)
Why: Miami shocked observers by selecting Ware at No. 15, betting on his rare mobility, shooting touch, and rim-running as a 7-foot rookie. The Heat trust their development staff to refine his motor and consistency. Ware’s high-upside athletic tools could pay dividends in their next championship contention window. <|endoftext|>"
Philadelphia 76ers,2024,"Team: Philadelphia 76ers
Position of Pick: PG
Context: Facing the fourth-highest salary for pick No. 16, Philly could use this asset in a package for a star. If they keep it, they need wing depth (Dalton Knecht or Ja’Kobe Walter) between Embiid and Maxey.

Available Players:

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Jared McCain (PG)
Why: Philadelphia added McCain at No. 16 for his shooting, competitiveness, and winning pedigree at Duke. He fits alongside Tyrese Maxey as an instant off-ball contributor and secondary playmaker in Philly’s rotation. McCain’s intangible makeup and floor spacing should yield early minutes with the Sixers. <|endoftext|>"
Los Angeles Lakers,2024,"Team: Los Angeles Lakers
Position of Pick: SF
Context: Assuming LeBron James returns, L.A. can’t be in prospect mode. Trading the No. 17 pick for win-now help is smart; if they keep pick No. 55, taking Bronny James as a late-round flier makes sense.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: AJ Johnson (SG)
Why: Milwaukee added Johnson at No. 23 after a quiet NBL season but strong combine, valuing his athleticism and scoring bursts. He joins a contender as a three-year developmental project with length and playmaking upside. The Bucks see him as a future rotation piece under a veteran-led culture. <|endoftext|>"
Washington Wizards,2024,"Team: Washington Wizards

New York Knicks,2024,"Team: New York Knicks

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Pacôme Dadiet (SF)
Why: New York selected Dadiet at No. 25, a raw but talented French wing who shined in Germany this season. They gambled on his per-minute scoring and skill set as a late-season riser. Dadiet slots into the Knicks’ long-term plans as a developmental perimeter threat. <|endoftext|>"
Oklahoma City Thunder,2024,"Team: Oklahoma City Thunder
Position of Pick: SF
Context: OKC could reunite Cody Williams with brother Jalen, adding a versatile forward. If he’s gone, they should address size/rebounding with a prospect like Zach Edey or Kel’el Ware.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Dillon Jones (SF)
Why: Oklahoma City traded future picks to land Jones at No. 26, adding a mid-major playmaker with size and instincts. Despite concerns about his range and athleticism, he projects as a rotational creator off the dribble. Jones joins OKC’s deep guard stable as a complementary ball-handler. <|endoftext|>"

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Terrence Shannon Jr. (SG)
Why: Minnesota kept No. 27 and selected Shannon, a proven scorer who was exonerated of charges before the draft. He replaces wing scoring depth and offers two-way athleticism behind their young core. Shannon should carve immediate minutes in a defensive backcourt. <|endoftext|>"
Phoenix Suns,2024,"Team: Phoenix Suns

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Isaiah Collier (PG)
Why: Utah seized Collier at No. 29, lured by his physical tools, playmaking, and strength for a pick-and-roll guard. He joins a rebuilding backcourt where patience is abundant and developmental reps guaranteed. Collier’s upside as a strong guard aligns with Utah’s timeline. <|endoftext|>"
Boston Celtics,2024,"Team: Boston Celtics
Position of Pick: SG/SF
Context: Assuming Payton Pritchard and Al Horford are brought back, Boston should be eyeing older wings in the draft who can step in and play immediately. This could include players such as Dayton’s DaRon Holmes II, UNC’s Harrison Ingram or Creighton’s Baylor Scheierman.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Baylor Scheierman (SG/SF)
Why: Boston picked Scheierman at No. 30 for his movement shooting, IQ, and mid-major production. He slots behind their championship core as a floor-spacing guard on a rookie deal. Scheierman’s veteran savvy and off-ball scoring should mesh with the Celtics’ system. <|endoftext|>"
Toronto Raptors,2024,"Team: Toronto Raptors
Position of Pick: PF

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Jonathan Mogbo (PF)
Why: Toronto selected sleeper Mogbo, a versatile, defensive-minded forward with strong passing and transition skill. He fits the Raptors’ development model and could become a useful role player if he adds perimeter shooting. Long-term flier with intriguing playmaking upside. <|endoftext|>"
Utah Jazz,2024,"Team: Utah Jazz
Position of Pick: PF/C
Context: After posting the worst defensive rating in NBA history, Utah needs defensive help in the backcourt — two-way wings like Ron Holland or Devin Carter can address this need.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:
Pick: Kyle Filipowski (PF/C)
Why: Utah landed Filipowski at No. 32, adding a skilled 7-footer with perimeter touch and offensive versatility. He fell into the second round but gives the Jazz a chance to develop his shooting and consistency. A likely rotational big with upside as he matures. <|endoftext|>"
Milwaukee Bucks,2024,"Team: Milwaukee Bucks
Position of Pick: SF/PF
Context: With few draft assets, the Bucks shouldn’t overthink picks 23 and 33 — taking the best player available adds depth behind Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton, whether in the backcourt or on the wing.

Question: Which player should they draft, and why?
### Response:

Why: Milwaukee added Smith after projecting as a late first-rounder, valuing his size, outside shooting and scoring per minute. He offers floor-spacing upside and took positive steps with G League Ignite. A developmental pick to bolster the Bucks’ long-term plans. <|endoftext|>"
New York Knicks,2024,"Team: New York Knicks
Position of Pick: PG
Context: Limited by cap and core depth, New York should either package their multiple picks to trade up for a veteran or, if they keep them, add a center as insurance for Isaiah Hartenstein with restricted Bird rights concerns.

Why: New York traded back into Round 2 for seasoned point guard Kolek, who brings pick-and-roll savvy and efficient shooting. He’ll compete for backup minutes behind Jalen Brunson and fits coach Thibodeau’s emphasis on toughness. Proven college playmaker in a low-risk move. <|endoftext|>"
Indiana Pacers,2024,"Team: Indiana Pacers

Los Angeles Lakers,2024,"Team: Los Angeles Lakers
Position of Pick: SG

New York Knicks,2024,"Team: New York Knicks

### Response:
Pick: Kevin McCullar Jr. (SG)
Why: New York drafted McCullar, a Kansas veteran with two-way production derailed by injury, as a potential quick contributor. If healthy, he provides perimeter defense and secondary playmaking. Value pick to deepen the rotation. <|endoftext|>"
Toronto Raptors,2024,"Team: Toronto Raptors
