Question: Which player should they draft?
### Response:
Pick: Ty Lawson (PG) <|endoftext|>"
Golden State Warriors,2009,"Team: Golden State Warriors
Position of Pick: PG
Context: Everybody knows the Warriors like to run, so any player they draft has to be agile. They are loaded at the wing positions, so they have no needs at all at shooting guard or small forward. Monta Ellis is not a pure point guard, so a pure point guard would be beneficial. Big men are always a need for the Warriors.

New York Knicks,2009,"Team: New York Knicks
Position of Pick: PF
Context: The Knicks may not lose too many players this offseason. Their only major player who is an unrestricted free agent is Chris Wilcox. Nate Robinson and David Lee are restricted free agents, and the Knicks may or may not re‑sign those two guys. Eddy Curry, Al Harrington and Quentin Richardson all have player options, but it would make sense that those three guys would exercise their options. The Knicks are in complete rebuilding mode and could use a lot of help.

Toronto Raptors,2009,"Team: Toronto Raptors
Position of Pick: SG
Context: The Raptors looked like an up‑and‑coming franchise a year or two ago, but that’s not the case anymore. They have some solid big men with Chris Bosh and Andrea Bargnani, but it is unknown if Shawn Marion will be re‑signed. José Calderón is a solid point guard, but Marcus Banks is the only backup.

Milwaukee Bucks,2009,"Team: Milwaukee Bucks

Context: The Bucks have some quality wing players with Michael Redd, Richard Jefferson, Joe Alexander and Charlie Bell.

New Jersey Nets,2009,"Team: New Jersey Nets
Position of Pick: SG
Context: Devin Harris is a free agent this summer, so the Nets may need a new point guard. They have plenty of wings returning next year with Vince Carter, Bobby Simmons, Chris Douglas‑Roberts (team option), and a few other bench players. At power forward, they have Yi Jianlian, Brook Lopez, Sean Williams, Josh Boone and Ryan Anderson, so the Nets don’t want to select a big man unless it’s a true center.

Context: The Bobcats have no frontcourt needs at all, as they have Emeka Okafor, Boris Diaw, Gerald Wallace, Vladimir Radmanovic, Nazr Mohammed, DeSagna Diop and Raja Bell all locked up at least through next season. At point guard, they just drafted DJ Augustin last year, but they could lose Raymond Felton (restricted free agent). The one position they could really use is a shooting guard.

Phoenix Suns,2009,"Team: Phoenix Suns
Position of Pick: SF
Context: It’s difficult to say who will or will not be back next season for the Suns, but no matter what happens, they need a small forward. After that, it depends on what happens in the offseason, but they will probably need another power forward and maybe another shooting guard.

Detroit Pistons,2009,"Team: Detroit Pistons
Position of Pick: SF
Context: The Pistons will be getting much younger this offseason when they lose Allen Iverson and Rasheed Wallace. Rodney Stuckey, Richard Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince will be the important players returning next season, but there will be no quality players in the frontcourt. They could re‑sign Jason Maxiell, Kwame Brown has a player option, and they also have Amir Johnson and Walter Sharpe, but even with those players, the Pistons still need at least a center.

Chicago Bulls,2009,"Team: Chicago Bulls
Position of Pick: SF
Context: The Bulls have really needed a true center for a few years now. Joakim Noah, Tyrus Thomas and Brad Miller can all play inside, but a quality 7‑footer would really give this franchise a boost. Derrick Rose is the future of this team, so there is no need at point guard, especially with Kirk Hinrich also on the roster. Ben Gordon is gone after this season, so a shooting guard is definitely needed.

Philadelphia 76ers,2009,"Team: Philadelphia 76ers
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Sixers are loaded in the frontcourt with big men Elton Brand, Samuel Dalembert, Reggie Evans, Marreese Speights and Jason Smith. They have Thaddeus Young and Andre Iguodala at the wings. Andre Miller is a free agent and Lou Williams isn’t a pure point guard, so they’re going to need a pure point guard. They also need some shooters, as there aren’t many Sixers players who can consistently knock down 3‑pointers.

Denver Nuggets,2009,"Team: Denver Nuggets
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Nuggets have a point guard (Chauncey Billups), a small forward (Carmelo Anthony) and a power forward (Kenyon Martin), but are lacking at shooting guard and center. JR Smith will be a free agent, leaving a need for a shooting guard. Nene isn’t a true center. Johan Petro isn’t a great player, plus he’s a restricted free agent. The Nuggets also need a point guard to back up Billups.

Context: Mike Bibby will be an unrestricted free agent and Acie Law may or may not be the point guard of the future for the Hawks, so they will certainly need a point guard.

Question: Which player should they draft?
### Response:
Pick: Jeff Teague (PG) <|endoftext|>"
Utah Jazz,2009,"Team: Utah Jazz
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Jazz have some question marks in the frontcourt, as Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur both could opt out at the end of the season. Without them, Kosta Koufos is the only big man they would have, so the Jazz certainly need to add another inside presence or two. They have Deron Williams at point guard and a few options at small forward, but Ronnie Brewer is the only option at shooting guard.

Pick: Rodrigue Beaubois (PG) <|endoftext|>"
New Orleans Hornets,2009,"Team: New Orleans Hornets
Position of Pick: PG
Context: Chris Paul is quite capable at point guard, but he could use a backup. The Hornets have five capable wing players, so there aren’t any needs there. David West is solid at power forward, but Tyson Chandler will likely be traded in the offseason, so they will need a center.

Portland Trail Blazers,2009,"Team: Portland Trail Blazers
Position of Pick: SF
Context: The Blazers don’t have a lot of needs, as they have a deep, young team that is solid all around. Jerryd Bayless is not a pure point guard and Steve Blake is not a great point guard, so that is a position they could use. Channing Frye is a restricted free agent, so they could use another power forward in case he isn’t with the team next year.

Oklahoma City Thunder,2009,"Team: Oklahoma City Thunder
Position of Pick: C
Context: The Thunder are building around Kevin Durant, Jeff Green and Russell Westbrook, so a shooting guard and center would fill in their holes. This franchise has had some trouble drafting centers over the last few years, so they may not be willing to take a risk for a center, especially when they have Nick Collison and Nenad Krstic, two guys who can do a decent job.

Dallas Mavericks,2009,"Team: Dallas Mavericks
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Mavs probably won’t re‑sign Jason Kidd this summer, and Jose Juan Barea and Jason Terry are the two other players who can play point guard, but Dallas could probably use another point guard, preferably a bigger one than Barea. They have a few shooting guards and Dirk Nowitzki and Josh Howard occupy the forward spots, so there aren’t any desperate needs there. Erick Dampier isn’t the best center in the world, and he’s the only one at that position, so a center is the biggest need.

Chicago Bulls,2009,"Team: Chicago Bulls
Position of Pick: PF
Context: The Bulls have really needed a true center for a few years now. Joakim Noah, Tyrus Thomas and Brad Miller can all play inside, but a quality 7‑footer would really give this franchise a boost. Derrick Rose is the future of this team, so there is no need at point guard, especially with Kirk Hinrich also on the roster. Ben Gordon is gone after this season, so a shooting guard is definitely needed.

Minnesota Timberwolves,2009,"Team: Minnesota Timberwolves
Position of Pick: SG
Context: The Wolves have two good young big men in Al Jefferson and Kevin Love, but not much depth at center. They have Sebastian Telfair and Randy Foye as point guards, but a bigger pure point guard would be useful. The Wolves also lack a big shooting guard. Foye is a small shooting guard, while Corey Brewer is more of a small forward.

New York Knicks,2009,"Team: New York Knicks
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Knicks may not lose too many players this offseason. Their only major player who is an unrestricted free agent is Chris Wilcox. Nate Robinson and David Lee are restricted free agents, and the Knicks may or may not re‑sign those two guys. Eddy Curry, Al Harrington and Quentin Richardson all have player options, but it would make sense that those three guys would exercise their options. The Knicks are in complete rebuilding mode and could use a lot of help.

Cleveland Cavaliers,2009,"Team: Cleveland Cavaliers
Position of Pick: SF
Context: The Cavs could lose Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Anderson Varejao this summer, as both have player options, so Cleveland could really use some help in the frontcourt. Ben Wallace doesn’t really carry a frontcourt and JJ Hickson has some potential, but the Cavs need to load up on big men.

Context: The Blazers don’t have a lot of needs, as they have a deep, young team that is solid all around. Jerryd Bayless is not a pure point guard and Steve Blake is not a great point guard, so that is a position they could use. Channing Frye is a restricted free agent, so they could use another power forward in case he isn’t with the team next year.

Houston Rockets,2009,"Team: Houston Rockets
Position of Pick: SG
Context: With Aaron Brooks and Kyle Lowry, two small point guards, running the plays for the Rockets, they need a big shooting guard to play alongside them. They have a great center in Yao Ming, a couple of decent power forwards, and some quality small forwards with Shane Battier and an aging Tracy McGrady. Plus, Ron Artest could be re‑signed.

Pick: Terrence Williams (SG) <|endoftext|>"
Portland Trail Blazers,2009,"Team: Portland Trail Blazers
Position of Pick: PF
Context: The Blazers don’t have a lot of needs, as they have a deep, young team that is solid all around. Jerryd Bayless is not a pure point guard and Steve Blake is not a great point guard, so that is a position they could use. Channing Frye is a restricted free agent, so they could use another power forward in case he isn’t with the team next year.

Context: With Aaron Brooks and Kyle Lowry, two small point guards, running the plays for the Rockets, they need a big shooting guard to play alongside them.

They could re‑sign Jason Maxiell, Kwame Brown has a player option, and they also have Amir Johnson and Walter Sharpe, but even with those players, the Pistons still need at least a center.

Question: Which player should they draft?
### Response:
Pick: Jeff Adrien (PF) <|endoftext|>"
Detroit Pistons,2009,"Team: Detroit Pistons
Position of Pick: PF
Context: The Pistons will be getting much younger this offseason when they lose Allen Iverson and Rasheed Wallace. Rodney Stuckey, Richard Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince will be the important players returning next season, but there will be no quality players in the frontcourt. They could re‑sign Jason Maxiell, Kwame Brown has a player option, and they also have Amir Johnson and Walter Sharpe, but even with those players, the Pistons still need at least a center.

Miami Heat,2009,"Team: Miami Heat
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Heat are loaded up on power forwards (some of which can play center) and shooting guards. Mario Chalmers and Chris Quinn (player option) are the point guards, but there are no small forwards returning. A big wing player, another point guard, and maybe a young 7‑footer are the needs for the Heat.

New Orleans Hornets,2009,"Team: New Orleans Hornets
Position of Pick: SG
Context: Chris Paul is quite capable at point guard, but he could use a backup. The Hornets have five capable wing players, so there aren’t any needs there. David West is solid at power forward, but Tyson Chandler will likely be traded in the offseason, so they will need a center.

Houston Rockets,2009,"Team: Houston Rockets
Position of Pick: SF
Context: With Aaron Brooks and Kyle Lowry, two small point guards, running the plays for the Rockets, they need a big shooting guard to play alongside them. They have a great center in Yao Ming, a couple of decent power forwards, and some quality small forwards with Shane Battier and an aging Tracy McGrady. Plus, Ron Artest could be re‑signed. The only other position the Rockets might be able to use other than shooting guard is a backup 7‑footer.

Dallas Mavericks,2009,"Team: Dallas Mavericks
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Mavs probably won’t re‑sign Jason Kidd this summer, and Jose Juan Barea and Jason Terry are the two other players who can play point guard, but Dallas could probably use another point guard, preferably a bigger one than Barea. They have a few shooting guards and Dirk Nowitzki and Josh Howard occupy the forward spots, so there aren’t any desperate needs there. Erick Dampier isn’t the best center in the world, and he’s the only one at that position, so a center is the biggest need.

Minnesota Timberwolves,2009,"Team: Minnesota Timberwolves
Position of Pick: PF
Context: The Wolves have two good young big men in Al Jefferson and Kevin Love, but not much depth at center. They have Sebastian Telfair and Randy Foye as point guards, but a bigger pure point guard would be useful. The Wolves also lack a big shooting guard. Foye is a small shooting guard, while Corey Brewer is more of a small forward.

Phoenix Suns,2009,"Team: Phoenix Suns
Position of Pick: SF

Atlanta Hawks,2009,"Team: Atlanta Hawks
Position of Pick: SG
Context: Mike Bibby will be an unrestricted free agent and Acie Law may or may not be the point guard of the future for the Hawks, so they will certainly need a point guard. Joe Johnson, Marvin Williams, Josh Smith and Al Horford occupy the 2‑4 positions, but a 7‑footer in the middle would help Smith and Horford.

Utah Jazz,2009,"Team: Utah Jazz
Position of Pick: C
Context: The Jazz have some question marks in the frontcourt, as Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur both could opt out at the end of the season. Without them, Kosta Koufos is the only big man they would have, so the Jazz certainly need to add another inside presence or two. They have Deron Williams at point guard and a few options at small forward, but Ronnie Brewer is the only option at shooting guard.

San Antonio Spurs,2009,"Team: San Antonio Spurs
Position of Pick: SG
Context: The Spurs are set at point guard with Tony Parker and George Hill, and at shooting guard with Manu Ginóbili, Roger Mason and Bruce Bowen. But they don’t have any real small forwards under contract for next season. Tim Duncan, Fabricio Oberto, Kurt Thomas and Matt Bonner make up the frontcourt, but they could use a young big man.

Indiana Pacers,2009,"Team: Indiana Pacers
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Pacers have three point guards, so they certainly won’t draft someone at that position. Danny Granger, Mike Dunleavy, Brandon Rush and Marquis Daniels (if the team picks up his option) occupy the wing positions. At power forward and center, all the Pacers have returning are Roy Hibbert, Troy Murphy and Jeff Foster. They could use some quality big men.

San Antonio Spurs,2009,"Team: San Antonio Spurs
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Spurs are set at point guard with Tony Parker and George Hill, and at shooting guard with Manu Ginóbili, Roger Mason and Bruce Bowen. But they don’t have any real small forwards under contract for next season. Tim Duncan, Fabricio Oberto, Kurt Thomas and Matt Bonner make up the frontcourt, but they could use a young big man.

Oklahoma City Thunder,2009,"Team: Oklahoma City Thunder
Position of Pick: SG
Context: The Thunder are building around Kevin Durant, Jeff Green and Russell Westbrook, so a shooting guard and center would fill in their holes. This franchise has had some trouble drafting centers over the last few years, so they may not be willing to take a risk for a center, especially when they have Nick Collison and Nenad Krstic, two guys who can do a decent job.

Portland Trail Blazers,2009,"Team: Portland Trail Blazers
Position of Pick: PG
Context: The Blazers don’t have a lot of needs, as they have a deep, young team that is solid all around. Jerryd Bayless is not a pure point guard and Steve Blake is not a great point guard, so that is a position they could use. Channing Frye is a restricted free agent, so they could use another power forward in case he isn’t with the team next year.

Dallas Mavericks,2009,"Team: Dallas Mavericks
Position of Pick: PF
Context: The Mavs probably won’t re‑sign Jason Kidd this summer, and Jose Juan Barea and Jason Terry are the two other players who can play point guard, but Dallas could probably use another point guard, preferably a bigger one than Barea. They have a few shooting guards and Dirk Nowitzki and Josh Howard occupy the forward spots, so there aren’t any desperate needs there. Erick Dampier isn’t the best center in the world, and he’s the only one at that position, so a center is the biggest need.

Cleveland Cavaliers,2009,"Team: Cleveland Cavaliers
Position of Pick: PF
Context: The Cavs could lose Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Anderson Varejao this summer, as both have player options, so Cleveland could really use some help in the frontcourt. Ben Wallace doesn’t really carry a frontcourt and JJ Hickson has some potential, but the Cavs need to load up on big men.

Boston Celtics,2009,"Team: Boston Celtics
Position of Pick: PG
Context: Rajon Rondo is a quality point guard, but the Celtics don’t have any real point guards to back him up. They tried Stephon Marbury, but that experiment isn’t going to last. They have plenty of wing players and big men. Kendrick Perkins is the only true center on the roster, but they will likely re‑sign Glen Davis and Leon Powe. With the amount of quality point guards available in this draft, it is safe to assume the Celtics will take one of them.

Question: Which player should they draft?
### Response:
Pick: Josh Akognon (PG) <|endoftext|>"
Los Angeles Lakers,2009,"Team: Los Angeles Lakers
Position of Pick: PF
Context: It’s difficult to say what a team as good and as deep as the Lakers really needs. Lamar Odom will be a free agent, so a small forward would be helpful, but they have a few other decent players at that position. Derek Fisher only has one year left on his contract and Jordan Farmar isn’t an incredible pure point guard, so a point guard is probably the biggest need for this team. Andrew Bynum and Pau Gasol are great players in the frontcourt, but there isn’t really any depth there, especially with Odom probably leaving.

Miami Heat,2009,"Team: Miami Heat
Position of Pick: SF
Context: The Heat are loaded up on power forwards (some of which can play center) and shooting guards. Mario Chalmers and Chris Quinn (player option) are the point guards, but there are no small forwards returning. A big wing player, another point guard, and maybe a young 7‑footer are the needs for the Heat.
