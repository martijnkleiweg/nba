[ 13 ]\n\nHouston Rockets (2012–2016)\n\nOn July 6, 2012, Motiejūnas signed a four-year, rookie scale contract with the Houston Rockets [ 14 ] and joined them for the 2012 NBA Summer League . In his summer league debut, he recorded 25 points, 9 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steals and 1 block. [ 15 ] After the game, he quoted a famous Lithuanian idiom describing his debut: \"Jeigu bijai vilko – neik į mišką\" ( English : If you're scared of wolves, don't go into the woods). [ 16 ] Overall, he averaged 16.3 points and 7.8 rebounds in four games. [ 17 ]\n\nOn November 14, 2012, Motiejūnas was assigned to Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League . [ 18 ] In his D-League debut on November 23, he recorded 31 points, 8 rebounds, 3 assists and 1 steals. Two days later, he was recalled by the Rockets. [ 19 ] He was later reassigned two more times throughout the season and in seven D-League games, he averaged 20.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. [ 20 ] In 44 games for the Rockets, he averaged 5.7 points and 2.1 rebounds per game.\n\nOn October 30, 2013, the Rockets exercised their third-year team option on Motiejūnas' rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2014–15 season. [ 21 ] As a result of a disappointing start to the 2013–14 season with little playing time, Motiejūnas said: “When you give everything you got, you want to get something back and we are not getting for a long time. It’s really not easy to just sit and watch when others are playing. I try to stay positive. I try to help the team. I try to be productive in practices. That’s all I can do. That’s all that is in my power and other things are not in my power so I can not be worried about those things.” [ 22 ] He went on to play 62 games for the Rockets while averaging 5.5 points and 3.6 rebounds per game.\n\nIn August 2014, Motiejūnas came under fire for comments made about his Rocket teammates James Harden and Dwight Howard , describing their relationship as \"Hi & bye. They even eat separately from the team. Usually in some fast food place.\" The comments came in an interview with Lithuanian media. [ 23 ] It was later revealed that Motiejūnas was misquoted in his comments due to an incorrect translation by Lithuanian media from Lithuanian to English. [ 24 ]\n\nOn October 30, 2014, the Rockets exercised their fourth-year team option on Motiejūnas' rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season. [ 25 ] With Dwight Howard out for a string of 11 games during November and December, and Terrence Jones out for the majority of the first half of the season, Motiejūnas began to dominate in shaping a career-best season as he averaged 14.3 points and 7.1 rebounds per game in Howard's 11-game absence. [ 26 ] Then, even with Howard's return on December 13, Motiejūnas scored a then career-high 25 points on 11-of-19 shooting to help the Rockets defeat the Denver Nuggets , 108–96. [ 27 ]\n\nOn January 30, 2015, Motiejūnas scored a career-high 26 points in a 93–87 win over the Boston Celtics . [ 28 ] On March 27, he was ruled out for one to two weeks with lower back pain and tightness. [ 29 ] However, the injury later ruled him out for the rest of the season [ 30 ] and put his chances of playing for the Lithuanian national team in doubt. [ 31 ]\n\nIn his third NBA season, Motiejūnas led the league in post-up field goal percentage (53.4%), with his biggest competitor being fellow Lithuanian Jonas Valančiūnas of the Toronto Raptors (51.3%). [ 32 ] In recognition, Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle awarded Motiejūnas an \"A\" grade for his 2014–15 season performance. [ 33 ]\n\nOn December 1, 2015, Motiejūnas was cleared to return to practice, having been out since March 2015 after requiring surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back. [ 34 ] Four days later, he returned to the Rockets' line-up and made his season debut, earning a standing ovation when he entered the game for the first time during the first quarter of the team's 120–113 win over the Sacramento Kings . He had one rebound and took a charge in six minutes of play. [ 35 ] He played in 14 straight games for the Rockets, including making one start, before more back pain forced him out again. He subsequently missed all of January's action, and on January 30, he was assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers for the first time since 2013 [ 36 ] to complete his rehab from the back injury. [ 37 ] He later received two more assignments to the Vipers. [ 38 ]\n\nOn February 18, 2016, Motiejūnas and Marcus Thornton were traded to the Detroit Pistons in a three-team trade involving the Rockets and the Philadelphia 76ers . [ 39 ] However, four days later, the Pistons rescinded their trade following a failed physical by Motiejūnas. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] On February 27, Motiejūnas returned to the Rockets' line-up and played for the first time since December 31. [ 42 ] The Rockets finished the regular season as the eighth seed in the Western Conference with a 41–41 record. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets faced the first-seeded Golden State Warriors, and in a Game 3 win on April 21, Motiejūnas recorded 14 points and 13 rebounds for his first career double-double in the postseason. [ 43 ]\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans (2017)\n\nAfter the 2015–16 season, Motiejūnas became a restricted free agent . On December 2, 2016, following a prolonged contract dispute with the Rockets which lasted into the first month of the 2016–17 season, he received a four-year, $37 million offer sheet from the Brooklyn Nets , [ 44 ] which the Rockets matched three days later. [ 45 ] A day after the Rockets matched his four-year offer sheet to retain him, Motiejūnas did not show up for his scheduled physical exam with the team. [ 46 ] Motiejūnas' camp made the decision to not report to the Rockets because of a difference of nearly $6 million from the offer sheet he signed with the Nets; the Rockets only had to match the principle terms of the offer sheet, which came to $31 million. [ 47 ] As a result, on December 9, the two sides negotiated a new four-year, partially guaranteed deal worth between $35 million and $37 million with bonus clauses. [ 48 ] While they appeared to have a new deal in place, Motiejūnas was sent home before the team's game on December 10 after taking a physical, [ 49 ] and five days later, the Rockets renounced the four-year deal and their rights to Motiejūnas, allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent. [ 50 ]\n\nOn January 3, 2017, Motiejūnas signed with the New Orleans Pelicans . [ 51 ] He made his debut for the Pelicans four days later, recording 11 points and five rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench in a 117–108 loss to the Boston Celtics . [ 52 ] An unexpected trade during the All-Star break for DeMarcus Cousins led to a diminishing role for Motiejūnas. He initially appeared in 21 consecutive games after signing with New Orleans, but from February 25 through April 4, he logged 11 DNPs out of a 20-game span. [ 53 ]\n\nShandong Golden Stars (2017–2019)\n\nOn August 9, 2017, Motiejūnas signed a one-year, $2.2 million contract with the Shandong Golden Stars of the Chinese Basketball Association . [ 54 ] It was reported that he was the highest paid foreigner of the whole league. [ 55 ] On February 1, 2018, Motiejūnas recorded a triple double leading his team to an important 127–103 victory versus the Jiangsu Dragons by scoring 29 points, grabbing 15 rebounds and dishing out 10 assists. [ 56 ] On March 13, 2018, Motiejūnas began the 2018 CBA Playoffs with 24 points, 7 rebounds and a victory versus the Jiangsu Dragons 104–100. [ 57 ] His team defeated Jiangsu Dragons 3–0 in the first round after their third 127–104 victory during which Motiejūnas scored 29 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. [ 58 ] In the semi-final, they faced Zhejiang Lions club, which offered a much higher competition. His team tied the series 2–2 after Motiejūnas solid contribution of 35 points (a career-high in China ) and 14 rebounds versus his direct opponent Ioannis Bourousis . [ 59 ] Despite his yet another astonishing performance of 31 points, 13 rebounds, 2 blocks and one assist, his team was eliminated in the series 3–4 after losing a decisive game 95–105. [ 60 ]\n\nOn November 8, 2018, Motiejūnas achieved his career rebounds record by grabbing 25 rebounds and scoring 24 points that led his team to a 100–82 victory versus the Jiangsu Dragons . [ 61 ] Less than a week later, on November 13, 2018, he improved his rebounds record once again by scoring 32 points and grabbing 32 rebounds, his team defeated the Shanghai Sharks 99–96. [ 62 ]\n\nOn March 3, 2019, Motiejūnas scored a career high 43 points, grabbed 17 rebounds, dished out 6 assists and led his team to a 122–83 victory. [ 63 ] Despite a terrific 2018–19 CBA regular season , during which he averaged 27.3 points, 14 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.8 steals, his team was eliminated in the first round of the 2019 CBA Playoffs , after losing 113–105 to the Jiangsu Dragons on March 20, 2019. [ 64 ]\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (2019)\n\nOn April 4, 2019, Motiejūnas signed with the San Antonio Spurs . [ 65 ] He declined to sign a new contract with the Spurs because the Shanghai Sharks of the CBA offered a much more valuable deal. [ 66 ]\n\nShanghai Sharks (2019–2020)\n\nOn August 27, 2019, Motiejūnas signed a $6 million contract with the Shanghai Sharks (about $1 million per month). [ 67 ] On October 1, 2019, he powerfully debuted his new team during a preseason game versus the Houston Rockets with 27 points, 11 rebounds, 3 steals and assists, however his team was crushed 71–140. [ 68 ] On June 9, 2020, it was reported that Motiejūnas had parted ways with the Shanghai Sharks . [ 69 ] In 28 games with the team, he averaged 22.8 points, a league-leading 15.1 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.8 steals and 0.5 blocks per game in 36.7 minutes of average playing time. [ 70 ]\n\nXinjiang Flying Tigers (2020–2021)\n\nOn September 17, 2020, Motiejūnas signed in China with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers . [ 71 ]\n\nAS Monaco (2021–present)\n\nOn August 18, 2021, Motiejūnas signed with AS Monaco Basket . [ 72 ] On July 21, 2023, he renewed his contract with Monaco through 2025. [ 73 ]\n\nNational team career\n\nMotiejūnas was a part of the Lithuanian Under-16, Under-18 and Under-20 junior national teams. With Lithuania's junior national teams, he played at the 2006 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship , both the 2007 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship and the 2008 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship , the 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Championship , and the 2009 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship .\n\nMotiejūnas led Lithuania's junior national team to the silver medal at the 2008 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship . Despite losing to Greece's junior national team in the gold medal game, he was named the MVP of the tournament, after averaging 18.2 points, 10.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. [ 74 ] At the 2008 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship , he averaged 11.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. [ 75 ]\n\nIn 2013, Motiejūnas won a silver medal with Lithuania's national team at the FIBA EuroBasket tournament and went on to compete for the national team at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup , where he averaged 7.4 points and 4.0 rebounds in nine games. [ 76 ]\n\nIn June 2015, Motiejūnas ruled himself out of the 2015 FIBA EuroBasket to continue recovering from a back injury he sustained while playing for the Houston Rockets. [ 77 ]\n\nPersonal life\n\nMotiejūnas has a large tattoo on his chest of an eagle clutching a basketball. He explained, \"I really like the attitudes of eagles. They never give up. When they grab a fish or something else, they never let it go.\" [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Motiejūnas is a fan of FC Bayern Munich and Germany national football team .

{"prospect": "Satnam Singh", "text": "Satnam Singh Bhamara (born 10 December 1995) is an Indian professional wrestler and former professional basketball player. As a wrestler, he is signed to the American professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW). He became the first Indian player to be drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA) when the Dallas Mavericks selected him with the 52nd overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft . At 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) [ 2 ] and 400 pounds (180 kg), [ 3 ] Singh played the center position. He played high school basketball at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida .\n\nEarly life\n\nSingh was born on 10 December 1995, to Balbir Singh and Sukhwinder Kaur in Balloke , a small, remote village located in the state of Punjab . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Both Singh's father, who played basketball due to his exceptional height, and his paternal grandfather were wheat farmers and millers. He grew up with two siblings, sister Sarabjot Kaur and brother Beant Singh Bhamara [ 5 ] [ 6 ]\n\nWhen he was nine years old, Singh stood 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m), taller than most people in his village. [ 5 ] His father helped introduce him to basketball and mounted a hoop in a dirt courtyard near his house. By local spectators, Singh was nicknamed \"Chhotu,\" meaning \"little one\" in Punjabi , as his rapid physical growth made the basketball seem to shrink in his hands over time. Singh soon saw great success in youth leagues in his state. [ 6 ]\n\nAt age 10, he enrolled at Ludhiana Basketball Academy in Ludhiana , Punjab, with the help of his father's friend Rajinder Singh. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] At the academy, Singh first learned many basketball skills and drills. [ 4 ] At age 14, Singh stood 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m), weighed 230 pounds (104 kg), and wore size-18 shoes. [ 6 ] As he was further exposed to professional basketball, including the NBA, he began idolizing Kobe Bryant and modeling his game after Yao Ming and Dwight Howard . [ 6 ]\n\nHigh school basketball career\n\nIn early 2010, it was announced that the global sports marketing business IMG was partnering with Reliance Industries , the largest corporation in India, to form a new company known as IMG Reliance (IMGR). They formed a new sports and entertainment marketing company and made their first move by signing a 30-year contract with the Basketball Federation of India (BFI). The decision was an attempt at improving the facilities and leagues in the country and they started allowing athletes to attend the Bradenton -based IMG Academy on a full scholarship. [ 6 ]\n\nSingh led the Punjab state youth team to a national championship in June 2010, leading the BFI to choose him to play at an NBA Basketball Without Borders camp in Singapore. The BFI's head coach, Harish Sharma, had him play against members of the Indian national team, and he managed to compete with them. Sharma recommended Singh for IMGR to consider him for a scholarship, but at 14 years of age, he was too old. Sharma said, \"This boy, you will want to see. I've told people many times, he can become India's Yao Ming.\" [ 6 ] Troy Justice, who directed basketball operations for the NBA in India, also visited Punjab and discovered Singh at the NBA Mahindra Challenge. [ 4 ] He said, \"First time I saw him play, he was wearing shoes that were falling apart. The seams had split, and he was coming right out of them. That's all he had. He was growing so fast. We helped him get shoes. I've heard people talk, but we're not sure they know how big he'll get.\" [ 4 ] Justice had confidence in him, however, saying, \"He can be the chosen one for basketball in India.\" [ 6 ]\n\nNevertheless, Singh was later awarded a scholarship under the IMGR basketball training academy and shifted to Bradenton, Florida in September 2010. Despite knowing no English at the time, he was one of 29 student-athletes—male and female combined—to be selected to train at IMG Academy. [ 4 ] [ 6 ] During the 2014–15 season, he averaged 9.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in less than 20 minutes per game for IMG, the No. 2 ranked team in the country. [ 7 ] However, due to his poor English and lack of American citizenship, Singh was ineligible for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). [ 8 ]\n\nProfessional basketball career\n\nIn April 2015, Singh was announced as an early entrant for the 2015 NBA draft . [ 9 ] At the draft on 25 June 2015, he was selected by the Dallas Mavericks with the 52nd overall pick, becoming the first Indian-born player to be drafted into the NBA. [ 10 ] Earlier he was interviewed by the Houston Rockets. The story of his interview by Daryl Morey, GM of the Houston Rockets is recounted in detail by Michael Lewis in his book The Undoing Project . [ 11 ] Singh also became the first player since the 2005 draft to enter without playing in college, overseas professionally, or in the NBA Development League . [ 12 ] On 8 July 2019, his draft rights were traded alongside two second round picks to the Memphis Grizzlies in a sign and trade for Delon Wright . [ 13 ]\n\nTexas Legends (2015–2017)\n\nIn July 2015, Singh joined the Mavericks for the 2015 NBA Summer League . [ 14 ] On 31 October 2015, he was acquired by the Texas Legends , the D-League affiliate of the Mavericks. [ 15 ] On 13 November 2015, he made his professional debut in a 104–82 loss to the Austin Spurs , recording four points, three rebounds and one assist in nine minutes. [ 16 ] On 5 February 2016, he had a season-best game with six points and six rebounds in 22 minutes of action as a starter in a 136–80 loss to Raptors 905 . [ 17 ] He appeared in 19 games (two starts) for the Legends during the 2015–16 season , averaging 1.5 points and 1.5 rebounds in 8 minutes per game. [ 18 ]\n\nOn 30 October 2016, Singh was re-acquired by the Legends. [ 19 ] After playing for the Legends during the 2016–17 season , he joined the Dallas Mavericks for the 2017 NBA Summer League . [ 20 ] In January 2017, he featured in a one-hour documentary on Netflix , titled \"One in a Billion,\" which covered his background and path to the NBA. [ 21 ]\n\nOn 3 November 2017, Singh signed a contract with the UBA Pro Basketball League in India. [ 22 ] In January 2018, he took part in the UBA US Pro Performance Camp in Phoenix, Arizona . [ 23 ]\n\nSt. John's Edge (2018–2019)\n\nOn 6 September 2018, Singh signed with the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada . [ 24 ] His arrival to the team's training camp was delayed by visa issues, which were settled after he contacted Canadian and Indian government officials through Twitter . [ 25 ]\n\nNational team career\n\nIn the summer of 2009, when he was 13 years old, Singh played for the Indian national under-16 basketball team at the 2009 FIBA Asia Under-16 Championship hosted by Johor Bahru , Malaysia. [ 6 ] He averaged 1.5 points per game in limited minutes, as his team finished in 10th place. [ 6 ] [ 26 ] Singh debuted for the senior Indian national team at the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship in Wuhan , China, where he averaged 2.5 points and 2.8 rebounds per game. [ 27 ] At the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship , he received more playing time, averaging 4.2 points and 2.7 rebounds for India. [ 28 ] Singh returned to his national team for the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup in Beirut , Lebanon. [ 29 ] However, he struggled to keep up with the pace and only played about eight minutes per game during the tournament. [ 30 ] Singh averaged just one point and 0.7 rebounds through three games. [ 31 ] In 2017 and 2018, he joined India at 2019 FIBA World Cup qualification , assuming a leading role due to the absences of multiple key players. [ 32 ] In 2020, Singh was handed a two-year ban by the National Anti-Doping Agency's (NADA) disciplinary panel for failing a dope test. [ 33 ]\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nOn 23 September 2021, he was signed by All Elite Wrestling . [ 34 ] He made his televised debut on the 13 April 2022 episode of AEW Dynamite , where he attacked Samoa Joe and aligned himself with Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt . [ 35 ] On 17 August 2024, Singh teamed with Raj Dhesi at the Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide event, Triplemanía XXXII: Mexico City , where they competed in a three-way tag team match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship , which they won, marking Singh's first title win in his career. The promotion vacated the titles on March 19, 2025.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\nLucha Libre AAA Worldwide AAA World Tag Team Championship ( 1 time ) – with Raj Dhesi [ 36 ]\n\nAAA World Tag Team Championship ( 1 time ) – with Raj Dhesi [ 36 ]\n\nReferences\n\n^ \"Satnam Singh, Basketball Player\" .

{"prospect": "Mitchell Robinson", "text": "Pine Forest (Pensacola, Florida)\n\nChalmette ( Chalmette, Louisiana )\n\nNBA All-Rookie Second Team ( 2019 )\n\nMcDonald's All-American ( 2017 )\n\nMitchell Robinson III (born April 1, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). [ 2 ] He was selected with the 36th overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft . Before beginning his professional career, he gained national coverage for withdrawing from his commitment to attend Western Kentucky University to instead dedicate the entire 2017–18 season for training on his own, being the first player to make such a decision.\n\nHigh school career\n\nMitchell Robinson attended Pine Forest High School in Pensacola, Florida, for the first two years of his high school career, briefly transferring to Landry-Walker College and Career Preparatory High School in New Orleans as a sophomore, for whom he never played. He did appear for Pine Forest as a freshman and sophomore, but did not make much of an impact, as he was still relatively new to basketball, only starting playing in eighth grade, during a growth spurt that took him from 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) to 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m). [ 3 ] He first appeared in the summer league before his junior year for Chalmette High School . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]\n\nAs a junior, Robinson led the Owls to their first state playoff win in 19 years, and in the second round, helped give the first seed and eventual state champion Natchitoches Central High School all they could handle before bowing out, their closest playoff game until the state final. He averaged 20.9 points, 13.6 rebounds, 8.1 blocks, and 2 steals per game. He made the all-district, all-Metro, and all-State teams for his efforts. Robinson then joined Dallas -based Nike Pro Skills on the AAU circuit for the summer, winning individual honors in the Nike EYBL and leading Pro Skills to the season-ending Peach Jam. His recruiting ranking shot up, and he earned his fifth star. Against the top players in the country, Robinson averaged 15.5 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 4.1 blocks per game, being named to the All-EYBL second team. [ 6 ]\n\nAs a senior at Chalmette, Robinson averaged 25.7 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6 blocked shots per outing, while earning Naismith Trophy All-America honorable mention and MaxPreps All-America honorable mention status as well as USA Today All-USA Louisiana first team honors and being named All-District, All-Metro, All-State, and the All-Metro Player of the Year from the New Orleans Advocate , as well as the St. Bernard Post Male Athlete of the Year for the parish. [ 7 ] He led Chalmette to their first district championship in their own regular season tournament in 20 years, first district title in 21 years in the toughest basketball district in the state, and to the state semifinals for the first time in 32 years. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] In the Owls' four-game state playoff run, Robinson averaged 34.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 7.8 blocks. Robinson became the first Chalmette basketball player to be named a McDonald's All-American , and also played in the Jordan Brand Classic and the LHSBCA All-Star game.\n\nPlaying in the 2017 McDonald's All-American Boys Game , Robinson tallied 14 points, three rebounds and two blocked shots. [ 10 ] He participated in the 2017 Jordan Brand Classic, scoring 15 points in 17 minutes of play, while pulling down three rebounds. [ 11 ]\n\nRobinson originally committed to play college basketball at Texas A&M , but then de-committed to follow coach Rick Stansbury to Western Kentucky . Stansbury had recruited Robinson as the Aggies' assistant coach. [ 12 ] Basketball writer Jason Frakes wrote in February 2017, Robinson \"may go down as the biggest recruiting coup in WKU basketball history.\" [ 13 ]\n\nCollege career\n\nIn July 2017, Robinson had enrolled at Western Kentucky University for the summer semester, and practiced with the team for about two weeks before a planned team trip to Costa Rica . Sources then indicated that he had left campus, and his room was cleaned out. [ 14 ] He was then suspended indefinitely for violating the team rules. [ 15 ] After speaking with head coach Rick Stansbury, he was granted a release to transfer, [ 16 ] and barring an unexpected decision by the NCAA, would have had to sit out the 2017–18 season .\n\nWith the hope that a waiver would be granted by the NCAA, Robinson took visits to Louisiana State University , University of Kansas , and the University of New Orleans in August 2017. [ 17 ] On August 27, Robinson returned to Western Kentucky a month after leaving campus. [ 18 ]\n\nOn September 18, Robinson announced he would forgo college and prepare for the 2018 NBA draft on his own accord. [ 19 ] He would be the first recruited draft pick to wind up not playing for any college, professional, or high school/ postgraduate team throughout an entire year before entering an NBA draft, although he would still be credited as coming out of Western Kentucky by the NBA. [ 20 ] Furthermore, because of his brief time going to summer classes in Western Kentucky, he was ultimately barred from participating in the NBA G League later in the season due to G League rules. [ 21 ] The ruling also affected a few similar prospects who were stuck in difficult situations at the time as well, like Billy Preston and De'Anthony Melton . The announcement also influenced at least one person to train by themselves for a year before entering an NBA draft, as fellow five-star recruit Darius Bazley originally planned on not going to college at Syracuse University in order to try out for the NBA G League before deciding against that as well.\n\nRobinson was named one of 69 players who planned to participate in the NBA Draft Combine . However, on the day of the event, Robinson withdrew from all combine events.\n\nProfessional career\n\nNew York Knicks (2018–present)\n\nOn June 21, 2018, Robinson was selected with the 36th overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft by the New York Knicks . [ 22 ] After appearing for the Knicks in the 2018 NBA Summer League , where he set summer league records for blocked shots and offensive rebounds, [ 23 ] he signed a multi-year, rookie-scale contract with the Knicks on July 8, 2018. [ 24 ] After struggling with an ankle injury during the preseason, Robinson made his professional debut on October 17, scoring two points in a 127–106 win against the Atlanta Hawks . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Robinson made his first start on October 26, recording seven points and six rebounds in 29 minutes of action in a 128–100 loss to the Golden State Warriors . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] On November 2, Robinson recorded his first double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds, alongside three assists and three steals, in a 118–106 win over the Dallas Mavericks . [ 29 ] On November 11, Robinson set the Knicks' rookie record with nine blocks in a 115–89 loss to the Orlando Magic . [ 30 ] On March 28, 2019, Robinson recorded season highs of 19 points and 21 rebounds in the Knicks' 117–92 loss to the Toronto Raptors , [ 31 ] and became the first Knicks rookie since Willis Reed in 1965 to record 19 points and 21 rebounds in a game. [ 32 ] On April 9, he recorded eight points and 17 rebounds in a 96–86 win over the Chicago Bulls . [ 33 ] Robinson finished the season second in the NBA in blocked shots per game, only behind Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers , and was named to the All-Rookie Second Team. [ 34 ]\n\nOn December 17, 2019, Robinson scored a career-high 22 points and recorded 13 rebounds in a 143–120 win against the Hawks. [ 35 ] On January 1, 2020, Robinson scored 22 points on perfect 11-of-11 shooting from the field in a 117–93 win against the Portland Trail Blazers . [ 36 ] On February 26, Robinson recorded a double-double with 12 points and a season-high 16 rebounds in a 108–101 loss to the Charlotte Hornets . [ 37 ] When the 2019–20 regular season finished, Robinson broke Wilt Chamberlain 's league record for highest field goal percentage in a single season. [ 38 ]\n\nOn February 12, 2021, in the Knicks' game against the Washington Wizards , Robinson fractured his right hand during the second quarter and did not return after halftime. [ 39 ] [ 40 ]\n\nOn July 12, 2022, Robinson re-signed with the Knicks on a four-year, $60 million contract. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] On November 30, he scored 15 points and grabbed 20 rebounds during a 109–103 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks . [ 43 ]\n\nOn September 23, 2024, it was announced that Robinson would miss the beginning of the regular season after offseason ankle surgery. [ 44 ] On February 28, 2025, Robinson returned from injury and put up six points and five rebounds in a 114–113 win over the Memphis Grizzlies . [ 45 ]\n\nNational team career\n\nRobinson was named to the preliminary roster of the United States national under-19 team in 2017, but did not make the final cut for the 12-man squad for the 2017 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup . [ 46 ]\n\nAt the tryout, Robinson measured 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) without shoes, 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) with shoes, 223 pounds (101 kg), with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan and 9 ft 3 in (2.82 m) standing reach. [ 47 ]\n\nPlayer profile\n\nRobinson has been called by some analysts \"the best shot blocker in his class\", with uncommon closing speed and a long reach that led to numerous highlight-reel blocks. He uses that speed also to run the fast break exceptionally well for a big man of his size, being called the \"most entertaining player\" in the New Orleans area for his ability to convert alley-oop dunks. Robinson improved his free throw shooting over the course of his two years at Chalmette, and developed range from behind the three-point line , making as many as five in a game. NBA draft projections have compared his game to DeAndre Jordan and Tyson Chandler .
