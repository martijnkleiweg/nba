Team,Needs,Context,Year
Atlanta Hawks,"C, SF","Most mock drafts have either tabbed Alex Sarr or Zaccharie Risacher in this spot, giving Atlanta a defensive-minded big or two-way wing to place alongside Trae Young, Dejounte Murray or both depending on how the rest of the offseason goes.",2024
Boston Celtics,"SG, SF","Assuming Payton Pritchard and Al Horford are brought back, Boston should be eyeing older wings in the draft who can step in and play immediately. This could include players such as Dayton’s DaRon Holmes II, UNC’s Harrison Ingram or Creighton’s Baylor Scheierman.",2024
Brooklyn Nets,"PG, SG","The only NBA team without a first- or second-round pick, the Nets should explore ways to get back into the 2024 draft. Brooklyn could get back into the middle or late first round by putting Dorian Finney-Smith on the table. Making Mikal Bridges available would likely draw a lot of interest from Houston, Charlotte and Memphis.",2024
Charlotte Hornets,"SF, PG","If the Hornets stay put at No. 6, they should be looking at wings who can defend and take over playmaking duties if LaMelo Ball suffers further ankle injuries. Charlotte finished 29th in team defense last season and could use a point-of-attack defender in the backcourt like UConn’s Stephon Castle.",2024
Chicago Bulls,"PF, SF","With Coby White and Nikola Vučević locked in at point guard and center, Chicago should target a forward in case DeMar DeRozan departs. The Bulls also need shooting after ranking 27th in made threes per game; Colorado’s Cody Williams would be an ideal fit.",2024
Cleveland Cavaliers,"SF, C","Despite retaining Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, Cleveland could use help on the wing or another big who can shoot and share the floor with Mobley or Allen — a stretch big or two-way wing fits this need.",2024
Dallas Mavericks,"SF, C","Dallas should look to add a two-way wing and a backup big to support Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving, as their bench struggled in shooting and rim protection late in the season.",2024
Denver Nuggets,"C, PF",It’s become clear that Zeke Nnaji isn’t the answer as a backup to Nikola Jokić. Finding someone who can play 15 minutes a night and not have the team fall apart remains the goal — targets like Kyle Filipowski or DaRon Holmes II would be ideal.,2024
Detroit Pistons,"SG, SF",Detroit was tied for dead-last in the NBA in made threes per game and ranked 26th in accuracy. Whoever they choose needs to be able to shoot — Reed Sheppard made 52.1% of his threes as a freshman and fulfills that need.,2024
Golden State Warriors,"PG, SG","With Chris Paul likely waived and Stephen Curry needing rest, Golden State will need another ball-handler off the bench. Seniors like UConn’s Tristen Newton or younger guards like Bronny James could be considered.",2024
Houston Rockets,"SF, PF",Rival teams say the No. 3 pick is for sale — Houston has enough young projects and should look to package this pick (and some young talent) for a proven wing or forward like Mikal Bridges or Donovan Mitchell if available.,2024
Indiana Pacers,"SF, PF","After an Eastern Conference Finals run, adding three rookies isn’t ideal. Indiana should explore packaging multiple second-rounders to try to get back into the late first round for a rotation-ready forward.",2024
Los Angeles Clippers,"PG, SG","With Russell Westbrook and James Harden aging, the Clippers should draft a floor general with upside in the mid-second round to learn under two future Hall of Famers.",2024
Los Angeles Lakers,"PF, SG","Assuming LeBron James returns, L.A. can’t be in prospect mode. Trading the No. 17 pick for win-now help is smart; if they keep pick No. 55, taking Bronny James as a late-round flier makes sense.",2024
Memphis Grizzlies,"C, PF","Memphis should be extremely interested in trading up for Donovan Clingan, a potential franchise center to pair with Jaren Jackson Jr., or grab a power forward with size and mobility.",2024
Miami Heat,"SF, SG","After drafting Jaime Jaquez Jr., Miami should again target a ready-to-play forward who can contribute immediately, such as Tristan da Silva or Devin Carter, to keep their Finals window open.",2024
Milwaukee Bucks,"PG, SF","With few draft assets, the Bucks shouldn’t overthink picks 23 and 33 — taking the best player available adds depth behind Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton, whether in the backcourt or on the wing.",2024
Minnesota Timberwolves,"PG, SG","Mike Conley Jr. turns 37 this fall, and with other veterans expiring, Minnesota needs playmaking depth — targeting a backup point guard who can learn and eventually take over.",2024
New Orleans Pelicans,"C, PF","If Jonas Valančiūnas departs, the Pels must replace their rim-protector and floor-spacing big — prospects like Kel’el Ware or Kyle Filipowski fit this hybrid center role.",2024
New York Knicks,"C, PF","Limited by cap and core depth, New York should either package their multiple picks to trade up for a veteran or, if they keep them, add a center as insurance for Isaiah Hartenstein with restricted Bird rights concerns.",2024
Oklahoma City Thunder,"SF, PF","OKC could reunite Cody Williams with brother Jalen, adding a versatile forward. If he’s gone, they should address size/rebounding with a prospect like Zach Edey or Kel’el Ware.",2024
Orlando Magic,"SG, PF","Orlando ranked dead-last in made threes and needs shooting. Targets like Rob Dillingham or Jared McCain address shooting, while a second-round pick could bring additional frontcourt size.",2024
Philadelphia 76ers,"SG, SF","Facing the fourth-highest salary for pick No. 16, Philly could use this asset in a package for a star. If they keep it, they need wing depth (Dalton Knecht or Ja’Kobe Walter) between Embiid and Maxey.",2024
Phoenix Suns,"C, PG","With Drew Eubanks disappointed as backup, Phoenix needs a young center who can stretch the floor (Yves Missi, Kel’el Ware) or a playmaking guard (Tyler Kolek, Isaiah Collier).",2024
Portland Trail Blazers,"SF, SG","Portland, with four picks, must fill its wing rotation around Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe — targeting floor-spacing wings like Matas Buzelis or Dalton Knecht.",2024
Sacramento Kings,"SG, SF","If Malik Monk leaves in free agency, the Kings need a Sixth Man replacement — prospects like Rob Dillingham, Devin Carter or Jared McCain offer shooting, defense and playmaking.",2024
San Antonio Spurs,"PG, SF","With picks 4 and 8, San Antonio can move up for another French prospect or select a polished point guard to pair with Victor Wembanyama, then take a long-term wing like Nikola Topić.",2024
Toronto Raptors,"SG, SF",Toronto finished 26th in shooting volume and accuracy — adding floor-spacers around Scottie Barnes via a trade-up or drafting prospects like Rob Dillingham or Dalton Knecht is crucial.,2024
Utah Jazz,"SG, SF","After posting the worst defensive rating in NBA history, Utah needs defensive help in the backcourt — two-way wings like Ron Holland or Devin Carter can address this need.",2024
Washington Wizards,"PG, C","The Wizards’ primary needs are at point guard and center, but more than anything, they crave a star — casting a wide net for whoever projects to be one, from Alex Sarr to Zaccharie Risacher.",2024
Atlanta Hawks,"SG, SF","The Hawks are all-in on Trae Young so they need to find some defence around him and some more shooters that he can feed with his crafty playmaking skills. Three-and-D are very much the watchword for the Hawks, and they may also elect to go for some size to fill the team need for another big man.",2023
Boston Celtics,"C, PF","The Boston Celtics have the deepest roster but are approaching a roster crunch with many stars needing new deals. If they stay all in on their core, they may look for a big man given Robert Williams III’s injuries and Al Horford nearing the end of his career, as well as possibly targeting frontcourt depth.",2023
Brooklyn Nets,"PG, SG","The Nets’ picks give them a chance to add offensive skills and a playmaker who can run the offence, while also needing another rebounder alongside Nic Claxton and Ben Simmons, addressing multiple frontcourt and backcourt gaps.",2023
Charlotte Hornets,"SG, SF","The Hornets will either go for a top prospect or package their picks, but are in need of talent across the board, including athletic wings and backcourt talent to complement LaMelo Ball and stop prolonged rebuild processes.",2023
Chicago Bulls,"PG, C","Without draft picks, the Bulls need a point guard who can run the offence and complement scorers like Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, and may look for interior reinforcements with Nikola Vucevic’s impending free agency.",2023
Cleveland Cavaliers,"SF, SG","The Cavaliers’ young core is set, but they need more shooting, particularly on the wings, and an on-ball defender to complement their perimeter stars and make the next step in the playoffs.",2023
Detroit Pistons,"PG, SG","With key young pieces in place, Detroit’s draft focus is on adding an athletic shooter and someone to help power the pace of the offence alongside Cade Cunningham and other backcourt talent.",2023
Indiana Pacers,"PF, SF","Holding multiple picks, the Pacers will likely target a power forward to complement their rim protection and athletic forwards with strong defensive skills to round out the core around Tyrese Haliburton and Bennedict Mathurin.",2023
Miami Heat,"PG, SG","Miami needs a shot creator with a reliable pull-up game to complement Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler, providing that third elite offensive component that could bridge the gap to championship contention.",2023
Milwaukee Bucks,"SG, SF","As the last pick in the draft, the Bucks seek a final piece to fit alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and the ageing core, ideally a big guard or wing who can shoot on the kick-out when the defence collapses.",2023
New York Knicks,,"The Knicks do not own a pick but, if they trade in, could look to add a player with significant upside to support their star core and maintain a competitive playoff window.",2023

Toronto Raptors,"SG, C",Toronto faces potential roster turnover and will likely target long-range shooting or an interior shot-blocker to surround Scottie Barnes and support a possible rebuild.,2023
Washington Wizards,"SG, SF","Rebuilding with young assets, Washington will look to the draft to find a high-ceiling guard or wing with upside to pair with future core pieces and reset the franchise.",2023

Houston Rockets,"SG, PG","Houston’s rebuild calls for players who can defend and a playmaker to facilitate around their young stars, emphasizing 3-and-D guards and secondary creators.",2023
Los Angeles Clippers,"PG, SF","Loaded at wing but lacking playmaking, the Clippers could use a pass-first guard to balance the offence and bouncy two-way wings to boost bench depth.",2023
Los Angeles Lakers,"SG, SF","The Lakers need shooters around LeBron James, prioritizing perimeter snipers and spacing wings to improve offensive balance and spacing.",2023

Charlotte Bobcats,"SG, PG","The Bobcats have no frontcourt needs at all, as they have Emeka Okafor, Boris Diaw, Gerald Wallace, Vladimir Radmanovic, Nazr Mohammed, DeSagna Diop and Raja Bell all locked up at least through next season.

Golden State Warriors,"C, PG, PF","Everybody knows the Warriors like to run, so any player they draft has to be agile. They are loaded at the wing positions, so they have no needs at all at shooting guard or small forward. Monta Ellis is not a pure point guard, so a pure point guard would be beneficial.

The only other position the Rockets might be able to use other than shooting guard is a backup 7‑footer.",2009
Indiana Pacers,"PF, C","The Pacers have three point guards, so they certainly won’t draft someone at that position. Danny Granger, Mike Dunleavy, Brandon Rush and Marquis Daniels (if the team picks up his option) occupy the wing positions.

They need a small forward and/or a big shooting guard.",2009
Los Angeles Lakers,"C, PF, PG","It’s difficult to say what a team as good and as deep as the Lakers really needs. Lamar Odom will be a free agent, so a small forward would be helpful, but they have a few other decent players at that position. Derek Fisher only has one year left on his contract and Jordan Farmar isn’t an incredible pure point guard, so a point guard is probably the biggest need for this team. Andrew Bynum and Pau Gasol are great players in the frontcourt, but there isn’t really any depth there, especially with Odom probably leaving.",2009

Milwaukee Bucks,"PG, C, PF","The Bucks have some quality wing players with Michael Redd, Richard Jefferson, Joe Alexander and Charlie Bell.

Foye is a small shooting guard, while Corey Brewer is more of a small forward.",2009
New Jersey Nets,"PG, C","Devin Harris is a free agent this summer, so the Nets may need a new point guard. They have plenty of wings returning next year with Vince Carter, Bobby Simmons, Chris Douglas‑Roberts (team option), and a few other bench players.

New Orleans Hornets,"C, PG","Chris Paul is quite capable at point guard, but he could use a backup. The Hornets have five capable wing players, so there aren’t any needs there.

New York Knicks,"SG, C","The Knicks may not lose too many players this offseason. Their only major player who is an unrestricted free agent is Chris Wilcox.

The Knicks are in complete rebuilding mode and could use a lot of help.",2009
Oklahoma City Thunder,"SG, C","The Thunder are building around Kevin Durant, Jeff Green and Russell Westbrook, so a shooting guard and center would fill in their holes.

Orlando Magic,"PF, C","Dwight Howard and Tony Battie are the only inside players for the Magic, as Rashard Lewis and Hedo Turkoglu are naturally small forwards.

Portland Trail Blazers,"PG, PF","The Blazers don’t have a lot of needs, as they have a deep, young team that is solid all around. Jerryd Bayless is not a pure point guard and Steve Blake is not a great point guard, so that is a position they could use. Channing Frye is a restricted free agent, so they could use another power forward in case he isn’t with the team next year.",2009
Sacramento Kings,"PG, C","The Kings are in rebuilding mode, and they have plenty of wings and power forwards, but they definitely need some point guards and centers. Kevin Martin, Francisco Garcia, Spencer Hawes and Jason Thompson are the future of this team, but they need a lot of help around them.",2009
San Antonio Spurs,"SF, PF, C","The Spurs are set at point guard with Tony Parker and George Hill, and at shooting guard with Manu Ginóbili, Roger Mason and Bruce Bowen. But they don’t have any real small forwards under contract for next season. Tim Duncan, Fabricio Oberto, Kurt Thomas and Matt Bonner make up the frontcourt, but they could use a young big man.",2009
Toronto Raptors,"SG, C, PF","The Raptors looked like an up‑and‑coming franchise a year or two ago, but that’s not the case anymore. They have some solid big men with Chris Bosh and Andrea Bargnani, but it is unknown if Shawn Marion will be re‑signed. José Calderón is a solid point guard, but Marcus Banks is the only backup. There aren’t really any returning quality wing players. The Raptors need a lot of help.",2009
Utah Jazz,"PF, C, SG","The Jazz have some question marks in the frontcourt, as Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur both could opt out at the end of the season. Without them, Kosta Koufos is the only big man they would have, so the Jazz certainly need to add another inside presence or two. They have Deron Williams at point guard and a few options at small forward, but Ronnie Brewer is the only option at shooting guard.",2009
Washington Wizards,"PG, PG","The Wizards had a terrible season, but the good news is that virtually their entire roster is returning next season. Their biggest need is certainly at point guard, where they have Gilbert Arenas (not a pure point guard), Mike James (player option) and Javaris Crittenton. They have plenty of returning players at every other position, so it’s difficult to choose another position they need to draft someone at.",2009
